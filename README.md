# Sun Market Project

This client-side project was created with Angular.
Design for this project was made with Angular-Material.

I started this project from scratch, This project follows clear guidelines given to me in a John Bryce course, and includes some features I added on my own initiative.

This project simulates a supermarket digital store website.
